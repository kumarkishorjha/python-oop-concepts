1. Class(blueprint) and Object(instance of Class)
2. Attributes(data or characteristics or what it has) of the Object.
    > called automatically as soon as an objets is created if it is inside the __init__ constructor.
3. Methods(functionalities or what it can do) of the Object.
4. Dunder Methods/Magic Methods
    > A special Method that let objects behave like
    built-in types and allow Python to call them automatically in certain situations.
    eg. (__init__(), __str__() etc. )
5. Why Python is called an OOP language?
    > Python is called an OOP language because almost everything in Python is an object
    created from a class. (eg. int, str, list etc.)
6. Advantages of OOP:
    > Using it we can create our own datatypes.
    > code reusability
    > Modularity
    > Debugging
