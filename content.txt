1. Class(blueprint) and Object(instance of Class)
2. Attributes(data or characteristics or what it has) of the Object.
    > called automatically as soon as an objets is created if it is inside the __init__ constructor.
3. Methods(functionalities or what it can do) of the Object.
4. Dunder Methods/Magic Methods
    > A special Method that let objects behave like
    built-in types and allow Python to call them automatically in certain situations.
    eg. (__init__(), __str__() etc. )
5. Why Python is called an OOP language?
    > Python is called an OOP language because almost everything in Python is an object
    created from a class. (eg. int, str, list etc.)
6. Advantages of OOP:
    > Using it we can create our own datatypes.
    > code reusability
    > Modularity
    > Debugging
7.  made a basic OOP project, named "proj_1.py".  
8. Use of self as a first parameter inside methods and __init__ constructor?
    > self is nothing but the object itself which is used to access the attributes and methods
    > of the current object (instance) created from the class.
9. Encapsulation:- using it we can hide both the attribute and method which we don't want to expose.
    we make it private using _ or __ (eg:- self.__password = password or def __password(self))
    we can access it using (obj._classname__attribute). it is not recommended because it breaks
    the idea of encapsulation. Instead we use getter and setter.
10. getter and setter:-
    A getter method is used to retrieve (get) the value of a private attribute.
    A setter method is used to update (set) the value of a private attribute, often with validation.
11. static method:-
    Static method is a method inside a class that works independently without using
    the object (self) or the class (cls). You define it using @staticmethod decorator.
12. Inheritance:-
